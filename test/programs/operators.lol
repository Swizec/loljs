BTW operators use prefix notation which looks like this:

I HAS A X
BTW (1*2) + (3/4)
X R SUM OF PRODUKT OF 1 AN 2 AN QUOSHUNT OF 3 AN 4
VISIBLE "X IS :{X}"


BTW there are also some infinite arity operators (terminated by MKAY):
BTW here we nest the nary ANY OF inside the binary BOTH SAEM

VISIBLE BOTH SAEM ANY OF WIN AN FAIL AN FAIL AN FAIL MKAY AN WIN


BTW we can define our own functions which work a lot like operators
BTW we can nest function calls inside operator expressions:
BTW define an XOR
HOW DUZ I XOR YR ARG1 AN YR ARG2
  I HAS A X ITZ NOT BOTH SAEM ARG1 AN ARG2
  X R BOTH OF X AN EITHER OF ARG1 AN ARG2
  FOUND YR X
IF U SAY SO

BTW SMOOSH is an infinite arity concatenation operator
VISIBLE SMOOSH "XOR 1 AN 0 = " AN XOR 1 AN 0 MKAY MKAY

BTW now we use the function in a more complex expression:
BTW this reads: 'xor(0+1, 0) + 2' = 3
VISIBLE SUM OF (XOR (SUM OF 0 AN 1) AN 0 MKAY) AN 2
